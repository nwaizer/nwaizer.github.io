Last night, members of the CNF-QE team met after work, and that got me thinking, that I want to write about them:
* [Shanks](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gowrishankar-shanks-rajaiyan-48a9577/) - Great manager, kind and attentive. Thank you for the advice and sharing your experience on so many dilemmas.  
* [Ofer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ofer-bochan-40ba211/) - Excellent networking skills, can really get anyone talking. Also great with IPv6 (stigidish.) 
* [Hen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hen-hassid-39a88a1a4/) - Really loves coding and true geek spirit.
* [Evgeny](https://www.linkedin.com/in/evgeniy-levin-gorokhov-a6a78612b/) - Love reading your code man.
