In order to publish this blog, I use Github pages feature, which [advices to try and use Jekyll](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/adding-content-to-your-github-pages-site-using-jekyll#about-content-in-jekyll-sites). So my first choice was to run a container.
As the [Readme](https://github.com/envygeeks/jekyll-docker/blob/master/README.md) suggested I ran:
```bash
export JEKYLL_VERSION=3.8
podman run --volume="$PWD:/srv/jekyll:Z" --publish 127.0.0.1:4000:4000 jekyll/jekyll jekyll serve
```

But wa told to change the permissions:
```bash
chmod a+rw $PWD/Gemfile.lock 
```

Only to arrive at:
```
/usr/gem/gems/jekyll-4.2.2/lib/jekyll/commands/serve/servlet.rb:3:in `require': cannot load such file -- webrick (LoadError)
```

which leads to running "bundle add webrick" in the container.
```bash
$ podman run --volume="$PWD:/srv/jekyll:Z" --publish 127.0.0.1:4000:4000 jekyll/jekyll bundle add webrick
```

which leads to allowing access to the Gemfile:
```bash
chmod a+rw $PWD/Gemfile
```

but then it all worked:
```bash
podman run --volume="$PWD:/srv/jekyll:Z" --publish 127.0.0.1:4000:4000 jekyll/jekyll jekyll serve
```
