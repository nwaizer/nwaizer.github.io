## Helper function errors
If the helper function can not solve an error it encounters, it should return a meaningful error. 

So 'EOF' is a bad error and 'failed to read config for Subscribe redfish due to: EOF' is better.

To achieve this do:

`if err != nil {
    return fmt.Errorf("failed to send submitTestEvent due to: %w", err)
}`

These errors can be handled by ginkgo and gomega.

## Linter
Find out which linter is used and run it in your editor, or at the CLI during development
